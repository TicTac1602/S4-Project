To use the decode project:

Include the decode.h file (and comment the main function of the decode.c file)

Feel free to test the function with all the printfs and the pause() function,
If you want, you can comment/delete all the printfs and pause() calls.

Init the matrix with either "initFromFile" function, or "initFromChar" function.

call the decode() function.

the decoded message is stored in the char* 'message' variable.

then, when you're done, call the freeDecodeAll() function to free all memory allocated variables.
