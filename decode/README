To use the decode project:

Include the decode.h file (and comment the main function of the decode.c file)

Feel free to test the function with all the printfs and the pause() function,
If you want, you can comment/delete all the printfs and pause() calls.

Init the matrix with either "initFromFile" function, or "initFromChar" function.

call the decode() function: it returns a memory allocated string with the decoded
messagee.

By the way, yes it is samy that coded this file as there is some doubters in my
discord dms, and it is also me that wrote this README.

You will also have to free decoded message by yourself in your file.
